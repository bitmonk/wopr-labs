# wopr-labs
Using a simulation of wopr from "wargames" as a silly use case for tinkering /
porting

# inspiration
I'm nowhere near the first person to think of doing this ridiculous thing, so
I'll crib from a couple projects I found:

 * [sysr-q/wopr.py](https://github.com/bitmonk/wopr.py)

 * [abs0/wargames (shell)](https://github.com/bitmonk/wargames-abs0-shell)

 * [UnexpectedMaker/wopr (arduino)](https://github.com/bitmonk/wopr-arduino)

 I've forked these into my github account so they don't disappear on me, but
 note the original authors.
